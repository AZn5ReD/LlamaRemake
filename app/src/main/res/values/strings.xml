    <string name="hrHelpAreas">"This tab shows you which areas you have trained your Llama to identify. Llama starts off with two areas: Home and Work. However, Llama does not know where you live or where you work. To teach Llama where you are, you need to physically be there.

Long-tap the area for your current location, or press the + button to create a new area. Llama will then ask you how long you plan on staying here. During that time, Llama will remember which phone masts are nearby, so that it can figure out where you are when you come back here.

The list also shows you how many phone masts (also known as cells) define each area. You can also use some experimental methods to determine your location by enabling them in Llama's settings (see Experimental)."</string>
    <string name="hrHelpEvents">"This tab shows you which events you have told your Llama to perform. Llama comes with some pre-defined events. You can modify or delete these, or add more.

An event contains some conditions and some actions. When all of the conditions are met, Llama will perform the actions for the event.

Most events come in pairs; you need one to turn something on, then another to turn something off, so you'll usually create two events with the event conditions reversed. e.g.

Enter Home -> Change Profile
Leave Home -> Change Profile

If you think events are occurring when they shouldn't be, you can press the history button to see what event happened, and what caused it.

You can also place shortcuts to events on your home screen/launcher. To do this, long tap an empty area of your home screen, choose Shortcuts, then Llama."</string>
    <string name="hrHelpProfiles">"This tab shows you which profiles you have told Llama to use. Llama comes with common profiles already defined, but you can change these or add more.

Profiles in Llama are similar to profiles in other non-Android phones; they let you group all of the different volume settings so you can change them with a simple tap. You can also tell Llama to change the profile automatically using events. Each profile can be given a notification bar icon, so you can quickly see which profile is activated.

You can also temporarily prevent Llama from changing the profile if you go to an important meeting. After a period of time, Llama will set the profile back to what it was. If you go to the settings screen, you can tell Llama to monitor your volume buttons, so if you manually set the volume to silent, Llama will turn on its profile lock."</string>
    <string name="hrHelpRecent">"This tab shows you which phone masts Llama has seen recently. After you have trained your Llama about an area, you'll be able to see which area a phone mast (also know as a cell) belongs to.

If you didn't have much time to train Llama, you may see cells saying 'Not added to any areas'. You can manually add these to the correct area by tapping the cell in the list. This list also shows the time, so you can remember where you were at that time and add it to the correct area.

If a cell is added to two different areas, then unfortunately you do not have enough phone masts nearby to determine the difference between the two locations. Try enabling the Experimental location methods."</string>
